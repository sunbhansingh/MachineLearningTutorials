#K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised learning. Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification. Once a point is to be predicted, it takes into account the 'K' nearest points to it to determine it's classification.

X = df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']] .values  #.astype(float)
X[0:5]

y = df['custcat'].values
print(y)
y[0:5]

Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance, it is good practice, especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based on distance of cases:

X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))
X[0:5]

Train Test Split
Out of Sample Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that that the model has NOT been trained on. Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy, due to the likelihood of being over-fit.

It is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train/Test Split. Train/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set.

This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_te
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)


Classification
K nearest neighbor (KNN)
Import library
Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

k = 4
#Train Model and Predict  
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)
neigh

yhat = neigh.predict(X_test)
yhat[0:5]

from sklearn import metrics
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat))




K in KNN, is the number of nearest neighbors to examine. It is supposed to be specified by the User. So, how can we choose right value for K? The general solution is to reserve a part of your data for testing the accuracy of the model. Then chose k =1, use the training part for modeling, and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your model.

We can calculate the accuracy of KNN for different Ks.

Ks = 10
mean_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
std_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
ConfustionMx = [];
for n in range(1,Ks):
    
    #Train Model and Predict  
    neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = n).fit(X_train,y_train)
    yhat=neigh.predict(X_test)
    mean_acc[n-1] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat)
​
    
    std_acc[n-1]=np.std(yhat==y_test)/np.sqrt(yhat.shape[0])
​
mean_acc


Plot model accuracy for Different number of Neighbors
plt.plot(range(1,Ks),mean_acc,'g')
plt.fill_between(range(1,Ks),mean_acc - 1 * std_acc,mean_acc + 1 * std_acc, alpha=0.10)
plt.legend(('Accuracy ', '+/- 3xstd'))
plt.ylabel('Accuracy ')
plt.xlabel('Number of Nabors (K)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print( "The best accuracy was with", mean_acc.max(), "with k=", mean_acc.argmax()+1)
