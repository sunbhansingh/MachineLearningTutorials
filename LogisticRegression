#Logistic Regression with Python
#In this notebook, you will learn Logistic Regression, and then, you'll create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?
While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.

Recall linear regression:

As you know, Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables  𝑥1 ,  𝑥2 , etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:

𝑦=𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+⋯
 

and finds the values of parameters  𝜃0,𝜃1,𝜃2 , etc, where the term  𝜃0  is the "intercept". It can be generally shown as:

ℎ𝜃(𝑥)=𝜃𝑇𝑋
 
Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function 𝜎:

ℎ𝜃(𝑥)=𝜎(𝜃𝑇𝑋)=𝑒(𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+...)1+𝑒(𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+⋯)
 
Or:
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑂𝑓𝑎𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠1=𝑃(𝑌=1|𝑋)=𝜎(𝜃𝑇𝑋)=𝑒𝜃𝑇𝑋1+𝑒𝜃𝑇𝑋
In this equation,  𝜃𝑇𝑋  is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), exp is the exponential function and  𝜎(𝜃𝑇𝑋)  is the sigmoid or logistic function, also called logistic curve. It is a common "S" shape (sigmoid curve).

So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:

Image

The objective of Logistic Regression algorithm, is to find the best parameters θ, for  ℎ𝜃(𝑥)  =  𝜎(𝜃𝑇𝑋) , in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case.

Customer churn with Logistic Regression
A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.

churn_df = pd.read_csv("ChurnData.csv")
churn_df.head()


#Data preprocessing
churn_df = churn_df[['tenure', 'age', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ', 'equip',   'callcard', 'wireless','churn']]
churn_df['churn'] = churn_df['churn'].astype('int')

#jaccard index
#Lets try jaccard index for accuracy evaluation. we can define jaccard as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets. If the entire set of predicted labels for a sample strictly match with the true set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise it is 0.0.

from sklearn.metrics import jaccard_similarity_score
jaccard_similarity_score(y_test, yhat)

confusion matrix
Another way of looking at accuracy of classifier is to look at confusion matrix.

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import itertools
def plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes,
                          normalize=False,
                          title='Confusion matrix',
                          cmap=plt.cm.Blues):
    """
    This function prints and plots the confusion matrix.
    Normalization can be applied by setting `normalize=True`.
    """
    if normalize:
        cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
        print("Normalized confusion matrix")
    else:
        print('Confusion matrix, without normalization')
​
    print(cm)
​
    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.colorbar()
    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))
    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation=45)
    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)
​
    fmt = '.2f' if normalize else 'd'
    thresh = cm.max() / 2.
    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):
        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt),
                 horizontalalignment="center",
                 color="white" if cm[i, j] > thresh else "black")
​
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.ylabel('True label')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, yhat, labels=[1,0]))


# Compute confusion matrix
cnf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, yhat, labels=[1,0])
np.set_printoptions(precision=2)


# Plot non-normalized confusion matrix
plt.figure()
plot_confusion_matrix(cnf_matrix, classes=['churn=1','churn=0'],normalize= False,  title='Confusion matrix')

Look at first row. The first row is for customers whose actual churn value in test set is 1. As you can calculate, out of 40 customers, the churn value of 15 of them is 1. And out of these 15, the classifier correctly predicted 6 of them as 1, and 9 of them as 0.

It means, for 6 customers, the actual churn value were 1 in test set, and classifier also correctly predicted those as 1. However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as error of the model for first row.

What about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row. It looks like there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0.

The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model’s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes. In specific case of binary classifier, such as this example, we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

print (classification_report(y_test, yhat))


log loss
Now, lets try log loss for evaluation. In logistic regression, the output can be the probability of customer churn is yes (or equals to 1). This probability is a value between 0 and 1. Log loss( Logarithmic loss) measures the performance of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
